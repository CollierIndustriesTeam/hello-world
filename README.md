# hello-world
Just another respository
Entrepreneur. Mom. Consultant. Web designer and developer. Aspiring photographer. Future Investor. I'm determined, hard-working, and goal oriented. It wasn't until I had my son that I truly knew how much talent I was gifted. It takes someone special to create a corporation from nothing- no family, one friend, and no money. I've created job security for many people and hope to continue that through the growth of Collier Industries and my future expeditures. Extreme motivation, determination, lots of tears, persistance, and many nights of no sleep and thinking is the start of creating something great. That's what i've done with Collier Industries. I will continue to create and inspire others through my web designs, expertise, public speaking, and being a great mom. I'm Hollie Collier and I hope today is the day I inspire YOU to create and inspire others!
